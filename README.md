# ChromGenomePlot
ChromGenomePlot provides a set of functions for analysis and visualization of diverse genomic features along the chromosomes of reference genome assemblies. It is primarily designed for analyzing highly contiguous (few scaffolds) or chromosome-level genome assemblies. It leverages 
tools and functions from matplotlib, seaborn, numpy and other popular python libraries. It can plot and calculate overall percent heterozygosity and/or along chromosomes using windows of specified size (kb). It can also plot coverage depth, GC content and other features based on .bed files along the chromosome windows.

## Usage

python3 chromgenomeplot.py -h
